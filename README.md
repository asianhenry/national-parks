# national-parks

This project explores data about national parks visitation.
Data was retrieved from https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/Reports/Home.

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

From the data, we visualized various trends in national parks over the last 20 years. We looked at some of the most popular parks in terms of
recreational visits, tent camping, backcountry visitors, etc. We also explore some other related trends such as REI membership and sales.
